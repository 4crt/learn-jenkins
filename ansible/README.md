Here are some basic examples of using ansible (configure instances to run jenkins on VMs).

Note that running jenkins in a such way is not the best practice. Use examlpes for learning.

Run examples from folders `chapter_one` and `chapter_two` respectively.

Understand what happens there. Compare playbooks and try to improve them.

Tip: consider ports creating given infra.
